How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It helped me quickly identify wanted changes and protect against unwanted changes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better
programmer in the long term?

It would allow me to start small and gradually build code. Each stage of development will meet specific goals. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
    
    For code, its better to have commit after making sure the code compiles and is reviewed. This is different than text which typically contains non-executable code.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is for software projects with groups several files in repository. Google docs typically handles text files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    
git log --stat
git diff <commit ID1> <commit ID2>

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
    
The safety of version control allow programmers to take chances and go for big ideas.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Not yet. Will use it for JavaScript later.
