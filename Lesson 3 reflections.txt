When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Collaborate with other people who may want to contribute towards project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

For code stability specially if there are multiple commits from different people expected for same feature.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork - copy repository on github
clone - copy local repository
branch - same repository but commit / test new code in private individual space 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Work offline
