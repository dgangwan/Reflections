When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Collaborate with other people who may want to contribute towards project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

For code stability specially if there are multiple commits from different people expected for same feature.
